    <p>
        Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Talike (pronounced tah-leek) and I am a 
        Production Engineering Fellow in the MLH Fellowship for summer 2022. This website
        serves as the home of all the concepts I have learned while taking part in the
        fellowship. Each week focused on a different concept and with every concept, this
        website continued to grow. Feel free to look around, get an idea of what was
        covered during the fellowship, and learn a little bit more about me!
